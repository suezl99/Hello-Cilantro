# Hello-Cilantro
All for urban farming, guerrilla gardening and social entrepreneurship.
I'm a former corporate lawyer and features journalist now dedicated to feeding the growing urban population in my community.
Sustainability is the key in giving people the dignity and joy in feeding themselves with affordable, tasty and nutritious greens and fruits grown locally. This has a huge impact on health, social-economic wellbeing, and the environment.
We are bringing "community" back into farming with best practices and developments in AI and data analysis.
